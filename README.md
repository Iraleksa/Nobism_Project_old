Nobism is a free and open source medical application.

The goal was to build a script that could load, pre-process, and send individual PDF to each users according to their own data.

I used a mix of Pyhon and R.

This project was incredibly interested, because of the wide scale of technique I had to use in order to build that script.

The first PDF was succesfully send the 16th of July.

I used Docker in order to send code to the owner of the App so he could use it on his own computer.

The container is available in my docker repository : docker pull docker.io/valvirdocker/nobism:latest
